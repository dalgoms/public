# Vibe Coding Portfolio (Origin Project)

My first experiment with AI-assisted building — before automation, before revenue systems.  
Human + AI collaboration, powered by Cursor.

(자동화도, 수익 시스템도 만들기 전 — AI와 함께 처음으로 "직접 만들어본" 실험 프로젝트입니다.)

## What is this

This is my first Vibe Coding experiment.

Before I started building:
- AI marketing automation
- Content factories
- Revenue operating systems

I began here — exploring how far I could go as a non-developer using Cursor AI.

This project represents the starting point of my AI journey.  
From creative prototyping → to production-grade systems.

(이후에 만들게 된 AI 마케팅 자동화, 콘텐츠 팩토리, Revenue Operating System — 그 모든 것의 시작이 바로 여기였습니다.)

## Why it matters

I wanted to test one simple idea:

> Can someone without a traditional engineering background  
> turn ideas into working products with AI?

The answer was **yes**.

This project proved that:
- Ideas can become interfaces
- Conversations can become code
- AI can act as a real builder, not just a chatbot

(아이디어는 곧 UI가 되고, 대화는 코드가 되며, AI는 단순 챗봇이 아니라 "빌더"가 될 수 있다는 것을 확인했습니다.)

## Project Characteristics

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Approach | Vibe Coding (Human + AI pair building) |
| Tool | Cursor AI |
| Background | Non-developer / No-Code |
| Dependencies | None (Pure HTML / CSS / JS) |

---

## Tech Stack

Intentionally lightweight.

- HTML5 (Semantic structure)
- CSS3 (Custom properties, animations, responsive)
- Vanilla JavaScript (Interactions + cursor effects)
- Google Fonts (Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, Space Mono)

Single HTML file. No build process required.

(의도적으로 가볍게 구성. 빌드 과정 없이 바로 실행됩니다.)

---

## Included UI Experiments

- Custom mouse cursor
- Intro animation
- Noise texture overlay
- Responsive layout
- Dark theme

---

## Running locally

```bash
open anomaly-studio.html
```

---

## What I learned

- AI works best as a creative partner, not a replacement
- Structure matters more than tools
- Once you can "talk to systems", you can design systems

This mindset later evolved into:
- → AI Marketing Automation
- → Content Factory Architecture
- → Revenue Operating Systems

(이 사고방식은 이후 AI 마케팅 자동화, 콘텐츠 팩토리, Revenue Operating System으로 확장되었습니다.)

## About Vibe Coding

Building through conversation with AI.

1. Describe intent
2. AI generates implementation
3. Human refines direction
4. Repeat

It's not about perfect code. It's about momentum.

(완벽한 코드보다 속도와 흐름이 중요합니다.)
